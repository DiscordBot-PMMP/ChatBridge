English Help Document

Below is a short help document to what you can change in the config.yml and what it will do.

Messages section shows the most info, as the sections below are almost the exact same.
If something is not covered assume it has been documented in another event section above (probably messages).

-------- Config.yml documentation --------

version: 1                                              <- This is the version of the config.yml. DO NOT TOUCH, EVER.

presence:                                               <- Presence section allows you to update the bots 'status'/'presence'
  status: "Idle"                                        <- This is the bots' status, can be one of the following (Idle, Online, Offline, Dnd)
  type: "Playing"                                       <- This is the bots' activity type, can be one of the following (Playing, Streaming, Listening, Watching)
  message: "on a PMMP Server!"                          <- This is the message after the type, can be anything.
